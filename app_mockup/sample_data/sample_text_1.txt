The death penalty should be abolished in all civilized nations. The primary argument for abolition rests on the irreversibility of execution: if the state executes an innocent person, there is no way to undo this grave error. Studies have shown that approximately 4% of death row inmates are likely innocent.

Proponents of capital punishment argue that it serves as a deterrent to violent crime. However, comprehensive research across multiple states and countries has consistently failed to demonstrate any significant deterrent effect. States without the death penalty actually have lower murder rates on average.

Furthermore, the administration of the death penalty is riddled with racial and economic disparities. Black defendants are significantly more likely to receive death sentences than white defendants for comparable crimes. Those who cannot afford quality legal representation are disproportionately sentenced to death.

Some argue that the death penalty provides closure to victims' families. While this emotional argument has merit, it cannot justify a system that risks executing innocent people and perpetuates systemic inequalities. Alternative punishments like life imprisonment without parole can protect society while avoiding these moral hazards.
