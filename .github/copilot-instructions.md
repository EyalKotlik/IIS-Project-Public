# GitHub Copilot Agent Instructions

These instructions guide automated agents (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) when working on this repository.

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Test Coverage for All Changes

**For any new feature or code change:**
- **MUST** include new tests or update existing tests
- Tests must cover the main functionality and edge cases
- Tests must be deterministic (no flaky tests)
- Tests must pass before finalizing any PR

**For bug fixes:**
- **MUST** include a regression test when feasible
- The regression test should fail on the old code and pass on the fixed code
- Document the bug scenario in the test docstring

### 2. Running Tests

**Before finalizing any PR:**
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m unit          # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration   # Integration tests only
pytest -m regression    # Regression tests only

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app_mockup --cov-report=term

# Run demo tests (for human verification)
pytest -k demo_pipeline -s
```

**All tests MUST pass before submitting a PR.**

### 3. Test Organization

Tests are organized in the `tests/` directory:
- `test_preprocessing.py` - Tests for preprocessing pipeline (57 tests)
  - Sentence segmentation
  - Discourse marker detection
  - Candidate flagging
  - Integration tests
  - Negative/edge case tests
  - Golden/regression tests
- `test_llm_extractor.py` - Tests for main extraction pipeline
- `test_qa_module.py` - Tests for Q&A module (26 tests)
- `test_synthetic_claims.py` - Tests for synthetic claim generation
- `test_conclusion_inference.py` - Tests for conclusion detection
- `test_llm_integration.py` - Tests for LLM client integration
- `tests/live/` - Live API tests (opt-in only, cost real money)

### 4. Test Markers

Use pytest markers to categorize tests:
- `@pytest.mark.unit` - Unit tests for individual functions
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration tests for full workflows
- `@pytest.mark.regression` - Regression tests with golden outputs
- `@pytest.mark.negative` - Edge cases and error conditions
- `@pytest.mark.demo` - Human-readable demonstration tests
- `@pytest.mark.live_api` - Live API tests (require explicit opt-in via RUN_LIVE_API_TESTS=1)

### 5. Test Quality Standards

**Tests must be:**
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
- **Isolated**: No side effects between tests
- **Fast**: Unit tests should run in milliseconds
- **Clear**: Descriptive names and docstrings
- **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and modify

**Avoid:**
- Network calls (mock external dependencies)
- Large model downloads (skip or mock if model not available)
- Random behavior (use fixed seeds if randomness needed)
- File system pollution (use temp directories, clean up)

**Live API tests:**
- The `tests/live/` directory contains tests that make real OpenAI API calls
- These tests are **skipped by default** and require explicit opt-in
- To run: `RUN_LIVE_API_TESTS=1 pytest -m live_api -s`
- Never run live tests in CI (they consume real credits)
- Live tests should be minimal and budget-safe

## ROADMAP.md Update Requirements

- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 2. Code Quality

- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Comment complex logic only when necessary
- Keep functions small and focused

### 3. Dependencies

- Check for security vulnerabilities before adding
- **When adding a new dependency:**
  - **MUST** update `requirements.txt` (for pip users)
  - **MUST** update `environment.yml` (for conda users)
  - Ensure version pins target the same version ranges (note: conda uses `=` or `.*` syntax while pip uses `>=,<`)
- **When changing Python version compatibility:**
  - **MUST** update the Python version in `environment.yml`
  - **MUST** update Python version references in README.md
  - **MUST** test with the new Python version before finalizing

### 4. Documentation

   - Review ROADMAP.md for context

2. **Plan the changes**
   - Identify minimal changes needed
   - Plan test additions/updates
   - Check if ROADMAP.md needs updating

3. **Implement changes**
   - Write code changes
   - Add/update tests
   - Run tests frequently during development

   - Request review

### Error Handling

**If tests fail:**
- Read the failure message carefully
- Run the specific failing test: `pytest tests/test_file.py::test_name -v`
- Fix the issue or update the test if behavior changed intentionally
- Never skip or remove failing tests without understanding why

**If unsure about changes:**
- Ask for clarification in PR comments
- Document assumptions in code comments
- Add TODO comments for follow-up work

## Project-Specific Context

### Current Phase
- Post-Milestone 2 (Initial Mockup complete)
- Repository cleanup complete (2026-01-27): Removed ~5,000 lines of unused code
- Working toward Milestone 3 (Demo Video) and Milestone 4 (Final Prototype)

### Code Architecture & Hygiene

**Single Sources of Truth:**
1. **Extraction Pipeline**: `app_mockup/llm_extractor.py` is the only extraction implementation
   - Do NOT create alternative extraction pipelines
   - All extraction logic goes through llm_extractor.py
   - Uses OpenAI structured outputs API directly

2. **Graph Data Structures**: `app_mockup/backend/graph_construction.py`
   - Provides GraphNode and GraphEdge classes only
   - Do NOT duplicate these classes elsewhere

3. **Q&A Module**: `app_mockup/backend/qa_module.py`
   - Single Q&A implementation
   - Do NOT create alternative Q&A systems

4. **LLM Client**: `app_mockup/backend/llm_client.py`
   - Single LLM client with caching and budget tracking
   - All LLM calls should go through this client

**Before Adding New Modules:**
- Check if functionality already exists
- If it exists, extend the existing module instead of creating a new one
- If you must create a new module, document why in PR description
- Remove deprecated modules when adding replacements

**Preventing Code Duplication:**
- Do NOT create multiple implementations of the same functionality
- Do NOT create "v2" modules alongside old modules - replace the old one
- Do NOT keep unused "example" or "prototype" files in the main codebase
- Move deprecated code to git history, not to `archive/` folders

### Key Components
1. **Preprocessing** (✅ Complete, ✅ Well-tested)
   - Sentence segmentation
   - Discourse marker detection
   - Candidate flagging

2. **Extraction** (✅ Implemented in llm_extractor.py)
   - LLM-based component classification
   - LLM-based relation extraction
   - Synthetic claim generation
   - Conclusion inference

3. **Q&A** (✅ Implemented)
   - Graph-grounded question answering
   - Chat memory

4. **UI/Frontend** (✅ Basic implementation)
   - Streamlit app (app.py)
   - Graph visualization
   - Node details panel

### Testing Philosophy
- **Comprehensive**: Cover main paths and edge cases
- **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and update
- **Fast**: Quick feedback during development
- **Reliable**: Deterministic, no flaky tests
- **Human-readable**: Demo tests for sanity checking
